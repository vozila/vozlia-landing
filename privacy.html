        <p>
          Vozlia (“we,” “our,” “us”) provides an AI-powered voice assistant and
          communication platform that helps users screen calls, manage conversations,
          summarize emails, and interact with automated services through voice or
          text. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and
          protect personal information when you use the Vozlia platform, including
          our website, backend API, AI assistant services, and integrations with
          third-party providers.
        </p>

        <p>
          By using Vozlia, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy
          Policy.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <p>We may collect the following information you provide to us directly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account information</strong> such as name, email address, phone number, or user ID.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Voice or text queries</strong> you provide to the assistant during calls or chat
            sessions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email data</strong> if you authorize Gmail or other providers through OAuth, including
            email metadata and content necessary to perform requested actions (such as
            summaries or searches).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Context information</strong>, such as channel, device type, or call-related metadata.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p>
          When you interact with Vozlia, we may collect certain information
          automatically, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Voice audio streams</strong> during calls, provided through real-time telephony
            integrations (for example, Twilio Media Streams).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transcriptions</strong> of spoken conversations generated by AI models.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>System and application logs</strong>, including timestamps, call session IDs, error
            logs, and performance metrics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Basic device or network information</strong> such as IP address, browser type, or
            operating system.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Information From Third-Party Integrations</h3>
        <p>
          If you connect external services, we may collect limited information
          required to perform the actions you request.
        </p>

        <h3>Google OAuth / Gmail</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you authorize Gmail access, we receive a secure OAuth access token
            and (if granted) a refresh token.
          </li>
          <li>
            We read email metadata and content only when you explicitly request a
            summary, search, or related operation.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not modify, delete, or send emails on your behalf unless a future
            feature explicitly requires that permission and you consent to it.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Twilio (Telephony)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            During phone calls, Twilio provides real-time audio packets to our
            backend so the assistant can hear and respond.
          </li>
          <li>
            Twilio may retain call-related metadata (such as duration and caller ID)
            according to its own policies.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>OpenAI (AI Processing)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We use OpenAI’s APIs to handle speech recognition, language
            understanding, response generation, and speech synthesis.
          </li>
          <li>
            OpenAI receives the audio and text prompts necessary to generate
            responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            We configure OpenAI’s APIs so that your data is not used to train or
            improve OpenAI’s models beyond Vozlia’s usage, in line with OpenAI’s
            API data-usage policies.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <p>We use collected information to provide, maintain, and improve Vozlia, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Operating the AI assistant</strong>, including understanding questions, generating
            responses, handling barge-ins (interruptions), and managing conversation
            flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performing tasks you request</strong>, such as checking unread emails, summarizing
            your inbox, or providing high-level updates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improving responsiveness and quality</strong> of interactions by analyzing usage
            patterns, latency, and system performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Maintaining security and preventing abuse</strong>, including fraud detection,
            troubleshooting, and enforcing our terms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data.  
          We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for third-party advertising.  
          We only access connected accounts (such as Gmail) when you explicitly
          request an action that requires that access.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2>3. How We Share Information</h2>

        <p>
          We only share your information with third parties when necessary to
          operate Vozlia or comply with the law.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1 Service Providers</h3>
        <p>
          We may share data with trusted service providers who assist in delivering
          Vozlia’s functionality, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Twilio</strong> – for telephony, call routing, and real-time audio streaming.</li>
          <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> – for speech-to-text, language understanding, and response generation.</li>
          <li><strong>Google</strong> – for OAuth authentication and email access when you connect Gmail.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These providers access only the minimum information necessary to perform
          their services on our behalf.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that such
          disclosure is necessary to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or government request.</li>
          <li>Protect the rights, property, or safety of Vozlia, our users, or the public.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share your data with advertisers or marketing networks.</p>

        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Encryption & Protection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            OAuth tokens and sensitive credentials are
            <strong>encrypted at rest</strong> using symmetric encryption (for example, Fernet).
          </li>
          <li>
            All external communication with Vozlia’s backend and third-party APIs
            uses <strong>HTTPS/TLS</strong> encryption.
          </li>
          <li>
            Access to decrypted tokens or sensitive data is strictly limited to
            systems that require it to perform operations on your behalf.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Data Retention</h3>
        <p>We follow a minimal-retention philosophy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Call audio</strong> is generally processed in real time and not stored by Vozlia,
            unless explicitly enabled for debugging or future features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transcriptions</strong> or conversation logs may be stored for a limited period to
            improve reliability, support features like summaries, or help you review
            past interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>OAuth tokens</strong> remain active until you revoke access or delete the
            integration.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may request deletion of your account and associated data as described
          in Section 5.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Access Control</h3>
        <p>
          Only authorized components of our system may access decrypted credentials.
          Any operational access is restricted, monitored, and performed only when
          necessary to support the service.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Disconnecting Integrations</h3>
        <p>You may revoke external integrations at any time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>By removing or disconnecting accounts within Vozlia (where available).</li>
          <li>By revoking access in your Google Account security settings for Gmail.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once revoked, Vozlia can no longer access data from that integration, and
          associated tokens become unusable.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Requesting Data Deletion</h3>
        <p>You may request deletion of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your Vozlia user account.</li>
          <li>Connected email accounts and their associated integration data.</li>
          <li>Logs or conversation records associated with your usage (subject to technical limits and legal requirements).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Opting Out of Certain Uses</h3>
        <p>
          You may choose not to connect external services such as Gmail and still
          use most of Vozlia’s core voice-assistant features. Some advanced
          capabilities will not be available without those connections.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>

        <p>
          Vozlia is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not
          knowingly collect or store personal information from children under 13. If
          we become aware that we have collected information from a child under 13,
          we will take steps to delete such information.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>

        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our products,
          features, or legal requirements evolve. When we make material changes, we
          will notify you by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Posting an updated version on our website; and/or</li>
          <li>Providing notice via email or in-app notification, where appropriate.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Your continued use of Vozlia after changes have been posted constitutes
          your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider" />
